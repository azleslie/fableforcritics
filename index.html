    <h1>A Fable for Critics</h1>
    <h3>by James Russell Lowell</h3>
    <h4>edited by <a href=https://azleslie.com>Alex Zweber Leslie</a></h4>
  </section>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><i>A Fable for Critics</i> generated a sensation when it was published in 1848. It was a send-up of American literature, then still in its salad years, with all its youthful pretensions and embryonic hopes. Was there really such a thing as a distinctively <i>American</i> literature? James Russell Lowell, whose authorship of the poem was an open secret, was hesitant—but not so much as to pass up the opportunity to knock its leading lights down a peg.</p>

    <p><i>A Fable for Critics</i> is essentially a string of jokes at the expense of authors, including the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson. We now consider these figures deeply serious and worthy of reverence, but in 1848 the jury was still out—or at least enough so that one could still get away with saying Hawthorne was womanly and Emerson didn’t make as much sense as he thought he did.</p>

    <p>Not that Lowell, himself a rising litterateur with his own aspirations and rivalries, could get off scot-free. Over the following months authors chimed in with all manners of takes ranging from approval to critique to parody (including a bitter clap-back from Edgar Allan Poe). All the leading magazines and then some wanted to get in on the conversation. In both its colorful content and its lively reception, <i>A Fable for Critics</i> provides a snapshot into the antebellum literary scene, with all its youthful comedy, boisterousness, cliques, feuds, ephemerality, and uncertainty about its future.</p>

    <p>For these very reasons, however, <i>A Fable for Critics</i> can be difficult to read almost two hundred years later. Many of the authors considered important in 1848 have slipped out of print and public memory altogether; many of the jokes are hard to identify without extensive knowledge of the period and the classics; much of what made the poem so exciting existed not in the poem itself but the practices of reading and sharing that it engendered. Yet <i>A Fable for Critics</i> is also strikingly contemporary. It is a roast; it reads more like a twitter thread—full of slang and inside jokes, amenable to skimming, selective reading, and excerpting—than either a timeless classic or an outdated history.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is to make <i>A Fable for Critics</i> and the world from which it sprang more accessible to scholars, teachers, students, and general readers alike. A table of contents provides quick links to the literary figures that receive extended treatment. Reference notes on the left briefly gloss allusions with an eye to illuminating jokes. Reception notes on the right accompany the lines that reviewers excerpted, highlighted on hover, providing the reviewing magazine and its assessment of that passage. Where a review referenced a specific passage in the poem without excerpting it, the assessment is included in the margin without text highlighting. Review citations and original paratext, such as the first edition title page and preface, are included as well.</p>

        <span class="reception nar"><b>North American Review</b>: "He evidently has no liking for Bryant's style of poetry, which is too calm and equable, which belongs too much to the old school, and has too much of the majesty of repose, to suit the admirers of the intense and fervid manner which is now most in vogue. The <i>gravamen</i> of the charge against him is, that he is more fond of depicting the various aspects of external nature, in their stillness and sublimity, than the passions of men and the woes engendered by them. It may be so; but we are quite willing to take Bryant's excuse for it in his own magnificent lines:<small><br>&nbsp &nbsp 'To him who in the love of nature holds<br>&nbsp &nbsp Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br>&nbsp &nbsp A various language; for his gayer hours<br>&nbsp &nbsp She has a voice of gladness, and a smile<br>&nbsp &nbsp And eloquence of beauty; and she glides<br>&nbsp &nbsp Into his darker musings with a mild<br>&nbsp &nbsp And healing sympathy, that steals away<br>&nbsp &nbsp Their sharpness, ere he is aware.'<br></small>It would be idle to quote further, for every person of taste in the country has the whole piece by heart, and in this <i>universal</i> popularity is the real test and seal of the poet's greatness. [...] We are now ready to hear the criticism of our poet-reviewer, without allowing his wit to dazzle our perception of the truth."</span></div>

        <span class='reference'>Margaret Fuller (1810-1850), journalist, critic, women's rights advocate, and Transcendentalist. She edited the latter group's journal, the <i>Dial</i>, wrote for the <i>New York Tribune</i>, and in 1845 published <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> in which "Miranda" appears as an alter ego sheperded by her father like the Miranda of Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i> (1611). Fuller receives Lowell's harshest treatment, perhaps because, as the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> noted, she had blasted him in <i>Papers on American Literature</i> (1846): Lowell "is absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy. His interest in the moral questions of the day has supplied the want of vitality in himself; his great facility at versification has enabled him to fill the ear with a copious stream of pleasant sound. But his verse is stereotyped; his thought sounds no depth, and posterity will not remember him."</span>
        <span class='nar'>But there comes Miranda, Zeus! where shall I flee to?</span>
        <span class='linenum'></span>
        <span class="reception"><b>Southern Literary Messenger</b>: "Every reader versed in our literary gossip, is at once put <i>dessous des cartes</i> as to the particular provocation which engendered the 'Fable.' Miss Margaret Fuller, some time ago, in a silly and conceited piece of Transcendentalism which she called an 'Essay on American Literature,' or something of that kind, had the consummate pleasantry, after <i>selecting</i> from the list of American poets, <i>Cornelius Mathews</i> and <i>William Ellery Channing</i>, for especial commendation, to speak of <i>Longfellow</i> as a booby and of <i>Lowell</i> as so wretched a poetaster 'as to be disgusting even to his best friends.' All this Miss Fuller <i>said</i>, if not in our precise words, still in words quite as much to the purpose. <i>Why</i> she said it, Heaven only knows—unless it was because she was Margaret Fuller, and wished to be taken for nobody else."</span></div>

A close friend of Lowell's, <i>A Fable for Critics</i> developed in a series of letters to Briggs from summer 1847 to summer 1848. As Lowell wrote in a preface to a late edition: "This <i>jeu d'esprit</i> was extemporized, I may fairly say, so rapidly was it written, purely for my own amusement and with no thought of publication. I sent daily installments of it to a friend in New York, the late Charles F. Briggs. He urged me to let it be printed, and I at last consented to its anonymous publication."</span>

He can afford to laugh at the whole reviewing fraternity. His wit is all his own, so sly and tingling, but without a drop of ill-nature in it, and never leaving a sting behind. His humor is so grotesque and queer, that it reminds one of the frolics of Puck; and deep pathos mingles with it so naturally, that when the reader's eyes are brimming with tears, he knows not whether they have their source in sorrow or in laughter. The great merits of his English style we noticed on a former occasion; for point, idiomatic propriety, and terseness, it is absolutely without a rival. Even our caustic rhyming reviewer gives him his full meed of praise in this respect."</span></div>

    <p>Above is a reproduction of the first American edition title page. The <i>Fable</i> was available in two bindings: paper boards at 50¢ and cloth at 63¢ (a standard "affordable" book price, roughly $16 and $20 in 2021 dollars respectively). It went through three editions of 1,000 copies each: the first issued in late October, the second in late December, and the third in February. The first edition contained 78 numbered pages (including preface) and 1 page, opposite the title, of advertisements for other G. P. Putnam books including Irving's collected works.</p>
    <p>The second and third editions contained 80 numbered pages with the addition of a second preface, plus additional pages for the original preface and, at the end of the volume, 8 pages of advertisements for other G. P. Putnam books including Poe's <i>Eureka, a Prose Poem</i> (1848) and works by other authors referenced in the <i>Fable</i>: Carlyle, Coleridge, Fouque, Goldsmith, and Lamb. The type for the second edition was reset by Leavitt, Trow & Co., printers and stereotypers at nearby 49 Ann Street, New York. Additional editions were not issued until Boston publisher Ticknor & Fields did so, from the same plates, in 1856, 1864, and 1865. The delay in British reviews (see Citations) owes from a lack of British editions until the end of the century.</p>
    <p>Below follows the first edition preface, reproduced in all subsequent editions. Like the poem itself, title and preface roughly follow anapestic tetrameter (two weak syllables followed by one strong, repeated four times per line).</p>

    <br>
    <div><span>It being the commonest mode of procedure, I premise a few candid remarks</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span><small>TO THE READER:</small></span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>This trifle, begun to please only myself and my own private fancy, was laid on the shelf. But some <span class='reference'>See line 1279 on Lowell and Briggs.</span> friends, who had seen it, induced me, by dint of saying they liked it, to put it in print. That is, having come to that very conclusion, I consulted them when it could make no confusion. For, (though in the gentlest of ways,) they had hinted it was scarce worth the while, I should doubtless have printed it.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>I began it, intending a Fable, a frail, slender thing, rhymeywinged, with a sting in its tail. But, by addings and alterings not previously planned,—digressions chance-hatched, like birds' eggs in the sand,—and dawdlings to suit every whimsy's demand, (always freeing the bird which I held in my hand, for the two perched, perhaps out of reach, in the tree,)—it grew by degrees to the size which you see. <span class='reference'>Variation on the folk tale of Milo of Croton, who grew stronger by carrying a calf every day as it gradually grew heavier.</span> I was like the old woman that carried the calf, and my neighbors, like hers, no doubt, wonder and laugh, and when, my strained arms with their grown burthen full, I call it my Fable, they call it a bull.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>Having scrawled at full gallop (as far as that goes) in a style that is neither good verse nor bad prose, and being a person whom nobody knows, some people will say I am rather more free with my readers than it is becoming to be, that I seem to expect them to wait on my leisure in following wherever I wander at pleasure, that, in short, I take more than a young author's lawful ease, and laugh in a queer way so like <span class='reference'>Mephistopheles, demon with whom the scholar Faust bargains his soul for knowledge in German folklore.</span> Mephistopheles, that the public will doubt, as they grope through my rhythm, if in truth I am making fun <i>at</i> them or <i>with</i> them.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>So the excellent Public is hereby assured that the sale of my book is already secured. For there is not a poet throughout the whole land, but will purchase a copy or two out of hand, in the fond expectation of being amused in it, by seeing his betters cut-up and abused in it. Now, I find, by a pretty exact calculation, there are something like ten thousand bards in the nation, of that special variety whom the Review and Magazine critics call <i>lofty</i> and <i>true</i>, and about thirty thousand <span class='reference'>Native American tribes experienced severe population decline due to Euro-American attacks, land seizure, and illnesses throughout the 1800s; Euro-American authors, however, often exaggerated and mischaracterized this fact into the self-justifying trope of the "vanishing Indian."</span> (<i>this</i> tribe is increasing) of the kinds who are termed <i>full of promise</i> and <i>pleasing</i>. The Public will see by a glance at this schedule, that they cannot expect me to be over-sedulous about courting <i>them</i>, since it seems I have got enough fuel made sure of for boiling my pot.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>As for such of our poets as find not their names mentioned once in my pages, with praises or blames, let them <small>SEND IN THEIR CARDS</small>, without farther <small>DELAY</small>, to my friend <span class='reference'>G. P. Putnam, New York publisher founded by George Putnam earlier in 1848 after dissolving an 1838 partnership with John Wiley in which he had published the first Library of American Books, edited by Duyckinck to include works by Fuller, Hawthorne, Mathews, Melville, Poe, Whittier.</span> <small>G. P. PUTNAM</small>, Esquire, in Broadway, where a <small>LIST</small> will be kept with the strictest regard to the day and the hour of receiving the card. Then, taking them up as I chance to have time, (that is, if their names can be twisted in rhyme,) I will honestly give each his <small>PROPER POSITION</small>, at the rate of <small>ONE AUTHOR</small> to each <small>NEW EDITION</small>. <span class='reference'>Nineteenth-century magazines offered "club rates" discounts on multiple copies sent to the same address.</span> Thus a <b>PREMIUM</b> is offered sufficiently <small>HIGH</small> (as the magazines say when they tell their best lie) to induce bards to <small>CLUB</small> their resources and buy the balance of every edition, until they have all of them fairly been run through the mill.</span></div>
    <br>
    <div><span>One word to such readers (judicious and wise) as read books with something behind the mere eyes, of whom in the country, perhaps, there are two, including myself, gentle reader, and you. All the characters sketched in this slight <span class='reference'>French, "play of spirit" or lighthearted cleverness.</span> <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, though, it may be, they seem, here and there, rather free, and drawn from a Mephistophelian stand-point, are <i>meant</i> to be faithful, and that is the grand point, and none but an owl would feel sore at a rub from a jester who tells you, without any subterfuge, that he sits in <span class='reference'>Diogenes, Greek cynic philosopher (412-323 BC) ridiculed for embracing poverty as societal critique to the point of living in a large ceramic jar or tub.</span> Diogenes' tub.</span></div>
