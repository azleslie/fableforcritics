    <h1>A Fable for Critics</h1>
    <h3>by James Russell Lowell</h3>
    <h4>edited by <a href=https://azleslie.com>Alex Zweber Leslie</a></h4>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><i>A Fable for Critics</i> generated a sensation when it was published in 1848. It was a send-up of American literature, then still in its salad years, with all its youthful pretensions and embryonic hopes. Was there really such a thing as a distinctively <i>American</i> literature? James Russell Lowell, whose authorship of the poem was an open secret, was hesitant--but not so much as to pass up the opportunity to knock its leading lights down a peg.</p>

    <p><i>A Fable for Critics</i> is essentially a string of jokes at the expense of authors, including the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson. We now acknowledge these figures as deeply serious and worthy of reverence, but in 1848 the jury was still out--or at least enough so that one could still get away with saying Hawthorne was womanly and Emerson didn’t make as much sense as he thought he did.</p>

    <p>Not that Lowell, himself a rising litterateur with his own aspirations and rivalries, could get off scot-free. Over the following months authors chimed in with all manners of takes ranging from approval to critique to parody (including a bitter clap back from Edgar Allan Poe). All the leading magazines and then some wanted to get in on the conversation. In both its colorful content and its lively reception, <i>A Fable for Critics</i> provides a snapshot into the antebellum literary scene, with all its youthful comedy, boisterousness, cliques, feuds, ephemerality, and uncertainty about its future.</p>

    <p>For these very reasons, however, <i>A Fable for Critics</i> can be difficult to read almost two hundred years later. Many of the authors considered important in 1848 have slipped out of print and public memory altogether; many of the jokes are hard to identify without extensive knowledge of the period; much of what made the poem so exciting existed not in the poem itself but the practices of reading and sharing that it engendered. Yet <i>A Fable for Critics</i> also seems oddly contemporary. It is a roast; it reads more like a twitter thread -- full of slang and inside jokes, amenable to skipping around and excerpting -- than either a timeless classic or an outdated history.</p>

    <p>The goal of this website is to make <i>A Fable for Critics</i> and the world from which it sprung more accessible to scholars, teachers, students, and general readers. A table of contents provides quick links to the literary figures that eceive extended treatment. Reference notes on the left briefly gloss allusions with an eye to illuminating jokes. Reception notes on the right accompany the lines reviewers excerpted, highlighted on hover, providing the reviewing magazine and their assessment of the particular passage. Where a review referenced a specific passage in the poem without excerpting it, the assessment is included in the margin without text highlighting.</p>
